# Password Strength Checker
Project Overview
This is a simple yet powerful Password Strength Checker tool that evaluates the security of a user's password based on several key factors. The tool helps users create stronger passwords by analyzing and providing feedback on password length, complexity, and repetition patterns. This project is designed to enhance security awareness and is useful for anyone looking to improve password hygiene.

Features
Length Analysis: Checks if the password meets minimum length requirements for enhanced security.
Complexity Check: Ensures that the password includes a combination of special characters, numbers, uppercase, and lowercase letters.
Repetition Detection: Identifies repeated characters or sequences that may weaken the passwordâ€™s security.
Real-time Feedback: Provides immediate feedback on the strength of the password (Weak, Moderate, Strong) with suggestions for improvement.
Technologies Used
Python/JavaScript: You can run the project in either language, making it flexible for different environments.
Regular Expressions: Used to validate password length and complexity.
Basic Encryption Concepts: Explores basic encryption techniques to store passwords securely.
User Authentication (Optional): Can be integrated into user authentication systems for enhanced security.
